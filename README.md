<i>A Decorator Interview App

## The Challenge
Build an app that shows recipes using a random ingredient after interacting with a refresh control.

### Ingredients
- egg
- apple
- flour
- chocolate

## Requirements
- Target iOS 9.0+
- Support iPhone and iPad
- Use Storyboards
- Use promises with PromiseKit where applicable
- Use the [RecipePuppy API](http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/)
- Use Alamofire to perform HTTP requests
- Use Realm to display recipes in a `UITableView`

### Notes
- Donâ€™t worry too much about quality (i.e. error messaging); it just needs to work
- If recipes with a given ingredient have already been downloaded, the app should display them immediately before performing a request to update the recipes
